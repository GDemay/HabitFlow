# HabitFlow

**HabitFlow** is a simple habit-tracking app developed in Swift. The goal of this project was to build my first Swift app within a few hours, purely for fun and to learn more about Swift development.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project was to create a working app quickly, leveraging Swift and SwiftUI to develop a useful tool for tracking daily habits. This app serves as an entry point into iOS development, created in a short span of time to explore the basics of app design, user interface, and data persistence.

## Features

- **Create Habits**: Easily add new habits to track daily routines.
- **Mark Habits as Done**: Keep track of which habits are completed for the day with a simple "Mark as Done" button.
- **Undo Habit Completion**: Undo habit completion for the current day if done by mistake.
- **Track Habit Streaks**: Automatically calculates and displays streaks for consecutive days of habit completion.
- **Circular Progress Indicator**: Displays progress toward your habit's deadline using a dynamic circular progress bar.
- **Calendar View**: See which days you have completed a habit in the current month.
- **Habit Persistence**: Habits are saved between app launches using `UserDefaults` for simple data persistence.
- **Edit Habit**: Modify habits at any time, including changing the name, priority, and deadline.
- **Dark Mode Support**: The app supports iOS Dark Mode for a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.

## Objective

The app is a result of experimenting with Swift and SwiftUI in a 2 hours. I never use Swift before. It showcases key functionality such as UI design, state management, and progress tracking.

## Future Improvements

This app was developed quickly as an exploration of Swift and Xcode, so there are many areas that could be improved or expanded upon in the future:
- More advanced analytics on habit progress.
- Push notifications to remind users about their habits.
- Synchronization with cloud services like iCloud or Firebase for multi-device support.

## Getting Started

To run the project:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the project in **Xcode**.
3. Set the target device to an iPhone simulator or a physical device.
4. Run the project and start tracking habits!
